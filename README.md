# Probability-and-Statistics-Project

This is my final project for Math 1320 at UMSL. I worked on two different topics using R: one about body temperature and one about predicting car prices.

## Topics I Covered

1. **Body Temperature Study**
   - I tested if the average body temperature is really 98.6°F using a t-test
   - I calculated mean, median, and standard deviation
   - I explained the results in a simple way that anyone can understand

2. **Car Price Prediction**
   - I used scatter plots and a regression line to predict car prices based on miles driven
   - I used R to draw the graph and explain the relationship between price and mileage

## What I Learned

- How to do basic statistics in R  
- How to make graphs and understand data  
- How to explain math in a way that’s simple and clear

## Tools I Used

- R and RStudio
